# Gridlock

A tiny, simple and dynamic grid system.

## How does it work?

Gridlock uses dynamic classes to create the perfect layout for your needs.

```html
<div class="row">
	<div class="column-5">This is a column.</div>
	<div class="column-5">This is a column.</div>
</div>
```

Providing your class names add up to that of the total columns, you can mix and match any amount of columns and widths you like.

## Properties

You can change any of the properties Gridlock uses to your liking, here is a table detailing the available properties you are free to tinker with:

| Name                 | Description                                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| gridlock-row-name    | The name used for the row class.            |
| gridlock-column-name | The name used for the column class.         |
| gridlock-columns     | The number of columns to use                |
